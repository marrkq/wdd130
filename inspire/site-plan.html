        [				Why will people come to your site?
        When people visit my website, they will likely fall into three categories, the first being employers who want to see my resume and skills, the second being people who are interested in my projects, and the last being those who want to read my blog. 
        Employers will be looking for specific qualities that align with their company's needs and culture. Those who are interested in my projects will be looking for inspiration and ideas, and they will want to see what I've been working on. And for those who enjoy reading blogs, they will likely be looking for insight on various subjects which I will hopefully be able to provide.
        I want to make sure that my website is accessible and engaging, And while my insights might not be very helpful now, in the future I hope to be educated enough that they are . Ultimately, I hope that my website will help me stand out in my career and in other areas of my life, and that it will lead to new and exciting opportunities.

        [   What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?
        When people visit my website, they'll be able to learn about my experience and credentials as a programmer. I'll showcase my previous projects and work, which I hope will inspire others and provide them with fresh ideas.
        I understand that I'm just starting out in my programming journey and I haven't completed many projects yet. I'm also in the process of earning my degree. However, I'm excited about the potential for growth and development that lies ahead.
        As I continue to work on new projects and learn more about programming, I'll update my website with new content that reflects my progress. I hope to create a dynamic and engaging portfolio that demonstrates my skills and showcases my creative abilities.
        In addition to showcasing my work, my website will also be a platform for me to connect with others who are passionate about programming. I hope to engage in discussions and exchange ideas with fellow programmers, students, and anyone else who is interested in this field.
        My website will mainly be focused on highlighting my skills and projects without requiring much, if any, information beyond myself. The main emphasis is on displaying my capabilities and demonstrating my talents to potential clients or employers. Additionally, the website will also offer a glimpse into my personality and hobbies. The website will be an expression of myself and a showcase of what I can do; for now, it will be simple because I have nothing worth showing, but that will change with time.

        [ BLOG
        The last section of my website will be dedicated to my personal blog, where I'll share my thoughts on various subjects and potentially document my experiences and endeavors. This blog will serve as a platform to provide visitors with insight into my personal interests and a more intimate view of my life.
        Through this blog, I'll share my opinions and ideas, which I hope will inspire and engage with my audience, fostering a community around topics I'm passionate about. Additionally, it will offer a place for me to experiment and document any future challenges or trials, allowing me to share my growth and journey with others.
        This paper will be small, consisting of just a small blog post, but later on I will update it and make it more expansive.
        In summary, my website will consist of three main pages, including a home page, a portfolio page, and a blog page. These sections will collectively showcase my professional and personal interests. Each page will be simple and elegant.
